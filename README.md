In this project I created an interactive banking app that helps high school students learn about financial responsibility. The app shows users how their investments can grow over time, giving them a hands on way to see the benefits of saving as well as the power of interest. The goal is to make financial education more accessible and to encourage high school students to gain smart financial habits from a young age. In this project, I effectively structured the code into separate functions to handle different tasks, which made my code organized and easier to understand. One area I could improve on is error handling for user input. The most challenging part of this project for me was calculating the monthly interest accumulation. Overall though this project helped me build essential skills in C++, forming a strong foundation in core computer science concepts.
